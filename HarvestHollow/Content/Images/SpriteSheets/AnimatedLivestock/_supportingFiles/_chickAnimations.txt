Here's a quick guide to help explain the chick animations.

The chick cell size is 16x16 (8 cells horizontally and vertically).
The first row contains the basic chick animations.
The second row is an eggshell-on-head variant of the same animations (just for fun).
The third row contains some egg hatching stuff.


Row 1 and 2:
	The 1st frame is your basic idle frame, facing down.
	Loop that with the 2nd frame for a hopping animation, which you can use for movement.

	The 3rd frame is the same basic idle as frame 1, but facing up.
	Loop it with the 4th frame for an upward facing hop/move.

	Loop frames 5 and 6 for a "cheep cheep" sort of thing.

	Frame 7 is a resting frame (sitting).

	Frame 8 is an alternate "cheep cheep", or maybe a talking frame?
	Everything is optional, folks!

Row 3:
	Ping-pong frames 1, 2, and 3 for a rocking egg shell, before it hatches.
	Frames 4 and 5 are the egg cracking before the chick emerges.
	Frames 6 and 7 are the "cheep cheep" frames, but this time from within the eggshell.
	Frame 8 is the empty shell.

These are just suggestions, you can use the animations however you want!
