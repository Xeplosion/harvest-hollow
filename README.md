## About Zambrin

### Style

The gameplay of Zambrin is similar to that of Stardew Valley and Rune Factory - A Fantasy Harvest Moon with the combat style being more inspired by games like Chrono Trigger and the OG Final Fantasy Series.

The graphics style is resemblant of NES and PS1 JRPGs. The main sources of inspiration for the game's graphics are the Mana Series, Tales of Phantasia, Secret of Evermore, Terranigma, Illusion of Gaia, Star Ocean, and Chrono Trigger. Most sprites are 16x16 pixels in dimension and the only really big difference in graphics is the use of a more detailed color palette.

### Setting

Nestled fifteen miles inland from the expansive sea of Nurnen, Caverston stands as a modest medieval haven, its existence defined by the rhythmic pulse of daily life and the encircling threat of nocturnal monsters. The town, home to a mere 200 souls, has undergone marked changes in the past dozen years, marked by the sudden emergence of creatures from the depths of the nearby caves. The origin of this phenomenon remains an enigma, shrouded in mystery.
Caverston's fortifications, a recent addition to its landscape, manifest as imposing walls designed to ward off the nightly incursions of these elusive monsters. Constructed meticulously, the walls encircle the town, serving as an unwavering barrier against the terrors that prowl in the darkness. Residents, once free to roam under the stars, now find safety within the town's confines, their daily activities governed by the ebb and flow of daylight.
To the north, the town's silhouette is dominated by the formidable presence of a castle, a stoic guardian that overlooks the landscape. This imposing structure, the nucleus of Caverston's governance, stands as a symbol of authority and protection. Its turrets pierce the sky, a constant reminder of the town's resilience against the encroaching darkness.
The western edge of Caverston is a bustling hub of activity, with a winding river that meanders gracefully beside businesses and workshops. This waterway serves a dual purpose, not only facilitating commerce but also acting as a natural deterrent to the monsters that plague the night. Creatures, it seems, harbor an aversion to water and, as folklore would have it, refuse to cross rivers.
On the eastern outskirts of the town, expanses of farmland stretch into the distance, providing a lifeline for Caverston's survival. Here, diligent farmers toil under the sun, cultivating crops that sustain the town's meager population. Yet, it is not the farmland directly outside the walls that provide sustenance; instead, Caverston relies on a trade network with neighboring towns. Ores and textiles, precious commodities acquired through taxation imposed by a distant king, are exchanged for the fruits of labor harvested from these fertile fields.
The southeast quadrant is a mosaic of quaint houses, each with its own story and familial history. These dwellings, though modest, exude a sense of unity and resilience, with families banding together to face the nightly threat. Streets wind between the houses, a network of pathways that serve as both connective tissue and refuge for the townspeople.
At the heart of Caverston lies a nexus of communal life. The chapel, with its weathered spire, stands as a testament to the enduring faith of the townsfolk. Nearby, the library offers a repository of knowledge, a sanctuary of learning amidst the uncertainty that shrouds the town. The marketplace, a vibrant tapestry of trade, is the economic heartbeat of Caverston, where goods from distant lands and locally produced wares change hands. Adjacent to the marketplace, a well, its waters drawn from unseen depths, symbolizes the endurance of the town in the face of adversity.
Weekly, the town experiences a transformation as the river becomes a conduit for essential supplies. Taxed goods, comprising ores and textiles, are exchanged with neighboring towns for the sustenance necessary for survival. The ebb and flow of trade, like the heartbeat of Caverston, echo through the town, underscoring the delicate balance between prosperity and peril.
In the quietude of the night, as the stars emerge and the town's denizens seek refuge within the protective embrace of their walls, Caverston stands resolute. A bastion against the unknown, a testament to the strength of community, and a reminder that even in the face of darkness, there is light.

### World

Zambrin takes place in a 15th century medieval town called Caverston. Although the region has the environmental and climate conditions of medieval Europe, the game takes place in a fictional region named Amberr. Amberr is the southern region of a large unnamed continent directly above the inland sea of Nurnen. 

Similarly to the medieval city of Kier Rus� located on the way from the Black to Baltic sea alongside a river, the town of Caverston is located alongside an important international trade route. However Caverston, unlike Kier Rus� was not created through the conquering, and instead inhabited by traders and merchants wishing to have a place to peacefully rest before continuing on their travels.

### Relations and Ecconomy

To the north of the city are several farming regions. The most notable of which are titled Greattomb, Dustwish, Pria, and Ambershaw.

The port city of Abouse located to the south of Caverston is significantly bigger, with a population of around 28,000 souls. This is the source of the majority of the merchants and travelers who visit the town of Caverston. The traders travel up the river Sillour to trade exotic goods for crops grown farther inland in order to feed their large population. As the traders travel back down the river, they stop at Caverston to trade excess food for the mysterious, and extremely valuable crystals and ores mined from the caves located all around the town of Caverston. 

Sometimes Merchants and their crews, tired from their long journey, spend the night in the town's inn. When this happens, merchants set up in carts located around town to sell off excess exotics that they failed to trade farther inland.
